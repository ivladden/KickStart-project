                Even in science fiction, supposedly the genre of limitless possibility, where everyone is invited to the adventure, heterosexual, heteroromantic, and cisgendered are considered the default, to the extent that everything else is "deviation," and must be eyed with suspicion. (For a timely example, look no further than the people recutting and remixing the recent finale of a popular animated series to take away the bisexuality of the main character (no spoilers!). Because only a male/female happy ending can truly be considered "happy.")
            </p>
            <p>
                Having already invited women to destroy science fiction, it was only fitting that LIGHTSPEED look for a new group of individuals who wanted to trade their feelings of marginalization for sledgehammers, and the "I Want to Destroy SF" inbox filled up all over again. People really wanted to break things in that most magnificent of ways: with prose.
            </p>
            <p>
                We're here. We have always been here. And we are very, very excited to show it.
            </p>
            <p>
                LIGHTSPEED was founded on the core idea that all science fiction is real science fiction. The whole point of this magazine is that science fiction is vast. It is inclusive. Science fiction is about people, and queer people, no matter how they identify [Gay, lesbian, bisexual, demisexual, asexual, pansexual, intersex, transgender, genderfluid, genderqueer--anyone who fits within the QUILTBAG], are a big part of that. We always have been. We're just sometimes hard to see. So, in the interests of visibility and breaking stuff, here we are to show you just how wide the spectrum of sexuality and gender identity can really be.

            <p>
            If we successfully fund, the special DOUBLE issue will contain the following additional material:
            </p>

                5 additional original, never-before-published short stories (for a total of 10)
                About 5,000 additional words of original flash fiction (for a total of about 10 flash stories)
                2 additional previously-published short stories (for a total of 4)
                Author Spotlights on the additional authors
                Even more assorted nonfiction features
                Plus, if we unlock one of our stretch goals, the issue will include additional material as well.

            <p>
            And naturally, all of the above will all be authored entirely by queer creators.

                <p>For this special issue, control of the magazine has been handed over to a talented team of queer creators:

<h1>Paul Boehmer, Podcast Producer</h1>

<p>Paul Boehmer attended his first Shakespearean play while in high school; he knew then that he was destined to become the classically trained actor he is today. Graduating with a Masters Degree, Paul was cast as Hamlet by the very stage actor who inspired his career path. A nod from the Universe he'd chosen aright! Paul has worked on Broadway and extensively in Regional Theatre; coinciding with another of his passions, Sci-Fi, Paul has been cast in various roles in many episodes of Star Trek. Paul's love of literature and learning led him by nature to his work as a narrator for Books on Tape, his latest endeavour. Paul is married to the love of his life, Offir and they live in Los Angeles with their two midnight-rambling Tomcats Dread & David.</p>

<h1>Cecil Baldwin, Podcast Host</h1>

<p>Cecil Baldwin is the voice of the wildly popular podcast Welcome to Night Vale, written by Joseph Fink and Jeffery Cranor.
